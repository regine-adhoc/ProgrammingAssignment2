I've included a command file and output from the command to demonstrate
my code in action. I had some problems defining the behavior for
'matrix has changed after inverse was cached' and included an extra
function, a safeCacheSolve, to handle that use case.

commands.Rhistory  : file of commands to check my functions
commands.output    : output of these commands
